# Robotics Basics

This repo utilized python [general_robotics_toolbox](https://github.com/rpiRobotics/rpi_general_robotics_toolbox_py) developed in RPI to perform
- Forward/Inverse kinematics
- Iterative Jacobian inverse kinematics
- Path planning with Jacobian matrix
- Much more to come

The repo is dedicated to show how the robotics math is realized with codes.
